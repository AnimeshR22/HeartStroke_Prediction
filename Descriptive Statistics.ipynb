Kurtosis is a measure of the peakedness or flatness of the probability distribution of a variable compared to a normal distribution. A positive kurtosis value indicates a relatively more peaked distribution with heavier tails, while a negative kurtosis value indicates a flatter distribution with lighter tails. A kurtosis value close to zero indicates a distribution similar to a normal distribution.\n\nHere are the inferences for each variable based on their kurtosis values:\n\nid: The 'id' variable has a kurtosis value of approximately -1.21, indicating a slightly flatter distribution compared to a normal distribution. This implies that the distribution of 'id' values has lighter tails and is less peaked.\n\nage: The 'age' variable has a kurtosis value of approximately -0.99, indicating a distribution that is slightly flatter than a normal distribution. This suggests that the distribution of ages in the dataset has lighter tails and is less peaked.\n\nhypertension: The 'hypertension' variable has a kurtosis value of approximately 5.38, indicating a distribution that is more peaked with heavier tails compared to a normal distribution. This suggests that the distribution of hypertension status has more extreme values.\n\nheart_disease: The 'heart_disease' variable has a kurtosis value of approximately 13.59, indicating a highly peaked distribution with very heavy tails. This suggests that the distribution of heart disease status has a significant number of extreme values.\n\navg_glucose_level: The 'avg_glucose_level' variable has a kurtosis value of approximately 1.68, indicating a distribution that is slightly more peaked with heavier tails compared to a normal distribution. This suggests that the distribution of average glucose levels has some extreme values.\n\nbmi: The 'bmi' (Body Mass Index) variable has a kurtosis value of approximately 3.36, indicating a distribution that is more peaked with heavier tails compared to a normal distribution. This suggests that the distribution of BMI values has more extreme values.\n\nstroke: The 'stroke' variable (target variable) has a kurtosis value of approximately 15.59, indicating a highly peaked distribution with very heavy tails.

Correlation measures the strength and direction of linear relationships between pairs of variables. The values in the matrix range from -1 to 1, where:\n\nA positive value indicates a positive correlation, meaning that when one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.\nA negative value indicates a negative correlation, meaning that when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\nA value close to 0 indicates a weak or no linear correlation between the variables.\nHere are the inferences based on the correlation matrix:\n\nAge vs. Avg_glucose_level: The correlation coefficient between 'age' and 'avg_glucose_level' is approximately 0.24, indicating a weak positive correlation. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for glucose levels to increase slightly with age. However, the correlation is not strong, indicating that age is not a major predictor of average glucose level in the dataset.\n\nAge vs. BMI: The correlation coefficient between 'age' and 'bmi' is approximately 0.33, indicating a weak positive correlation. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for BMI to increase slightly with age. However, as with 'avg_glucose_level', the correlation is not strong, indicating that age is not a major predictor of BMI in the dataset.\n\nAge vs. Stroke: The correlation coefficient between 'age' and 'stroke' is approximately 0.25, indicating a weak positive correlation. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for stroke occurrence to increase slightly with age. Again, the correlation is not strong, indicating that age is not the sole determinant of stroke risk in the dataset.\n\nAvg_glucose_level vs. BMI: The correlation coefficient between 'avg_glucose_level' and 'bmi' is approximately 0.18, indicating a weak positive correlation. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for average glucose levels to increase slightly with BMI. However, the correlation is not strong, indicating that BMI is not a major predictor of average glucose level in the dataset.\n\nAvg_glucose_level vs. Stroke: The correlation coefficient between 'avg_glucose_level' and 'stroke' is approximately 0.13, indicating a weak positive correlation. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for stroke occurrence to increase slightly with higher average glucose levels. However, the correlation is not strong, indicating that average glucose level is not the sole determinant of stroke risk in the dataset.\n\nBMI vs. Stroke: The correlation coefficient between 'bmi' and 'stroke' is approximately 0.04, indicating a very weak positive correlation. This suggests that there is a very slight tendency for stroke occurrence to increase slightly with higher BMI. However, the correlation is extremely weak, indicating that BMI is not a strong predictor of stroke risk in the dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', linewidths=0.5)\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix Heatmap')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-02T12:41:11.724302Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-02T12:41:11.724800Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.146290Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-02T12:41:11.724745Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.145057Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.corr()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.147875Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.148243Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.168071Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.148213Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.166664Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(data.corr(),annot=True)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.173495Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.174178Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.666938Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.174141Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.665892Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> #  **Covariance**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.cov()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.667923Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.668231Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.687547Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.668205Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.686753Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cov_matrix = data[numerical_columns].cov()\n\n# Step 3: Create the covariance matrix heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.heatmap(cov_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', linewidths=0.5)\nplt.title('Covariance Matrix Heatmap')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.688895Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.689411Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-02T12:41:13.048053Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-02T12:41:12.689379Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-02T12:41:13.046813Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(data.cov(),annot=True)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-02T12:41:13.049681Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-02T12:41:13.050825Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-02T12:41:13.570032Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-02T12:41:13.050781Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-02T12:41:13.569044Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
