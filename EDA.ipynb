Inference: \n------------\nThe quartile values for 'age' among individuals with and without stroke in the dataset provide valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of age within these two groups.\n\nFor individuals with stroke:\n\n* The first quartile (Q1) value of 59.00 suggests that approximately 25% of individuals with stroke are aged 59 years or below.\n* The median (50th percentile) value of 71.00 indicates that half of the individuals with stroke fall below the age of 71 years.\n* The third quartile (Q3) value of 78.00 implies that about 75% of individuals with stroke are aged 78 years or below.\n\nFor individuals without stroke:\n\n* The first quartile (Q1) value of 24.00 suggests that approximately 25% of individuals without stroke are aged 24 years or below.\n* The median (50th percentile) value of 43.00 indicates that half of the individuals without stroke are below the age of 43 years.\n* The third quartile (Q3) value of 59.00 implies that about 75% of individuals without stroke are aged 59 years or below.\n\nIn summary, from observation we can interpret that individuals with stroke tend to be older, as evidenced by the higher quartile values in comparison to individuals without stroke. The interquartile range (IQR) for individuals with stroke (Q3 - Q1 = 19.00) is narrower than that of individuals without stroke (Q3 - Q1 = 35.00), indicating a more concentrated distribution of ages among those with stroke. The data further highlights the potential significance of age as a predictive factor for stroke, with older age groups potentially having a higher risk of experiencing stroke.

The computed chi-square value is 81.61, and the associated p-value is 1.66e-19.\n\nConsidering a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (commonly used in hypothesis testing), the extremely low p-value (much less than 0.05) suggests that the observed association between hypertension and stroke is not likely to be due to random chance. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, which assumes that there is no relationship between hypertension and stroke.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the statistical analysis, we find strong evidence to support a significant relationship between hypertension and stroke in the given dataset. Individuals with hypertension appear to have a higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke compared to those without hypertension. This finding could be essential for understanding the risk factors associated with stroke and may have implications for preventive strategies and medical interventions to mitigate stroke risk in susceptible populations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nsns.countplot(x='ever_married', hue='hypertension', data=data)\nplt.title('Ever Married vs.
