Let's break down the implications of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Accuracy:\n\nMean Squared Error (MSE):\n\nThe MSE value shows 0.05725120323739136, which represents the average squared difference between the actual target values and the predicted values made by our linear regression model. A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, which is generally desirable. In this context, the MSE suggests that, on average, the squared difference between the predicted and actual stroke probabilities is relatively small.\n\nAccuracy:\n\nThe accuracy value shows 0.9393346379647749, which represents the proportion of correct predictions made by your model among all the predictions on the testing data. An accuracy of 0.9393 (or approximately 94%) indicates that our model correctly classified 94% of the instances in the testing set based on the predicted stroke probabilities. This is a measure of the model's overall correctness in terms of its predictions.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n**The low MSE value suggests that the model's predictions are reasonably close to the actual stroke probabilities.**\n\n**The high accuracy value indicates that the model's predictions are correct for around 94% of the instances in the testing set.**","metadata":{}}]}
